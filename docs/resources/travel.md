## Travel Policy: These guidelines are in effect May 15, 2019.

Principle:  We want to create an environment where members of the IS department are encouraged to take advantage of the academic opportunities at our two locations in Ithaca and at Cornell Tech. To encourage such interactions, academic-focused travel by Ph.D. students and faculty between the two campuses may be financially supported whenever there is a clear business purpose.

### Funding will be available for

1. Ph.D. student travels from one campus to another to network with prospective faculty advisors or committee members.
2. Ph.D. student with an advisor based at the other campus traveling to meet with their advisor/group.
3. Ph.D. student is taking one of the 5 IS core courses and would like to attend a lecture at the other campus in person.
4. Ph.D. student is traveling where the primary purpose is in service to the field or an academic event, ie. Ph.D visit day.   

The funding available to support Ph.D. travel is limited. Reimbursement is for transportation and lodging only and is capped at $500 per trip; the limit for any one traveler is 2 trips per academic year.  Subject to these limits, all travel in the above categories will be supported as long as funding is available. If funds for a particular semester run low, support for PhD travel will be prioritized with preference to travelers who have not already been supported in that semester.

### Funding is not intended for

1. Moving expenses
2. Non Cornell hosted conference travel
3. Recreation

### Travel planning process

To ensure smooth and convenient travel, and to ensure funds are still available, arrangements/approval for trips should be made in advance.  Reimbursements for trips not approved in advance may be denied if funding has run low.
