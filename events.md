## Information Science Seminar
IS Seminar is a weekly talk series that is more informal that the IS Colloquium. It is entirely run by the PhD students, although we sometimes invite faculty to give talks. These talks are open to the wider Cornell community. We meet on Thursdays at 12pm in Gates 203.

 

## Information Science Colloquium
The Information Science Colloquium (INFO 7090) regularly hosts leading scholars from around the world who are addressing today's biggest challenges in topics ranging from mobile sensing and virtual reality to HCI and workplace surveillance. Talks are typically held from 4 to 5 p.m. on Wednesdays in Gates Hall.

 

## Tea Time
Drink tea, eat snacks, and defragment. Join us on Wednesdays at 1:30pm in Gates 219.

 

## Tech/Law Colloquium
Launched in the fall of 2017 as a joint collaboration between Cornell Computing and Information Science (CIS) and the Cornell Law School, the Tech/Law Colloquium (INFO 6113/LAW 7113) is a series of dialogues with professors, practitioners and other scholars, investigating how law and new technologies interact and shape each other.
